# Welcome to the Onefootball hiring process

Let's go through some guidelines and general recommendations for your successful interview process

## Pair-programming

At Onefootball we incentivise working in pairs, as we believe in Extreme Programming practices and short feedback cycles. Having a pair programming as part of the interview process allow us to have a glimpse of a normal day of work with you.

### Backend/Platform positions

For this session we will pair through to simple problems in order to assess your coding skills. Let's go through some recommendations:

- Make sure you are in a machine you are confortable with, your favorite keyboard, a **working editor/IDE and runtime** of your favorite language;
  - Most of our backend is written in Golang, but we recognize that coding skills go beyond an specific technology/language;
- Before start we will ask you the share your screen, we want to see you _entire screen_ to ensure isonomy;
- Be free to search around, look at Stack overflow and documention is part of every-day job;
  -  Even AI tools are OK, as we use them everyday. In the interview we want to see your iterative process, how you write tests and design your 
     code and we believe that an AI can help but not do that for you;
- Be communicative, we want to hear your thought process;
- Ask whenever you need help or get stuck, even though this isn't a normal pairing session, interviwers will be more than happy to help you out;
